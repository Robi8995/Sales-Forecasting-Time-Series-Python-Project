## 🎯 Project Objective

**Objective:** Analyze 12 months of retail sales data across multiple cities and product categories to identify temporal sales patterns, discover top-performing products and markets, understand geographic revenue distribution, and build a predictive ARIMA time-series model for accurate monthly sales forecasting—enabling data-driven inventory management, targeted marketing campaigns, financial planning, and revenue optimization.

**Dataset:** 12 Monthly CSV Files (Jan–Dec 2019) | **Industry:** Retail & E-Commerce Analytics

**Problem Statement:**

Retail businesses face challenges in accurately predicting future sales, optimizing inventory levels, and allocating marketing budgets without clear forecasting models. Key questions remain unanswered: What are the monthly sales trends? Which products and cities drive revenue? How can we forecast future sales with confidence? Without accurate forecasting, retailers risk overstocking (excess inventory costs), understocking (lost sales), misaligned marketing spend, and suboptimal financial planning. This project provides comprehensive sales analysis, product-market profiling, geographic performance insights, and a statistical forecasting model (ARIMA) to enable proactive business decisions, maximize profitability, and improve operational efficiency.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

### Step 1: Merge Monthly CSV Files
```python
import os
import glob
import pandas as pd

# Set your folder path
input_folder = r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Sales Data"

# Get all CSV files
all_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(input_folder, "*.csv"))
print(f"Found {len(all_files)} CSV files")

# Read and combine
li = []
for filename in all_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    li.append(df)

# Merge into one DataFrame
combined_df = pd.concat(li, ignore_index=True)
print("✅ Combined shape:", combined_df.shape)
```

### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
```python
# Drop rows with missing critical values
combined_df = combined_df.dropna(subset=['Order Date', 'Sales', 'Purchase Address'])

# Convert Order Date to datetime
combined_df['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(combined_df['Order Date'], errors='coerce')
combined_df = combined_df.dropna(subset=['Order Date'])

# Extract temporal features
combined_df['Month'] = combined_df['Order Date'].dt.month
combined_df['Year'] = combined_df['Order Date'].dt.year

# Ensure Sales is numeric
combined_df['Sales'] = pd.to_numeric(combined_df['Sales'], errors='coerce')
combined_df = combined_df.dropna(subset=['Sales'])

# Extract City and State from Purchase Address
combined_df['City'] = combined_df['Purchase Address'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1].strip())
combined_df['State'] = combined_df['Purchase Address'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[2].split()[0])

print(f"Rows after cleaning: {len(combined_df)}")
```

### Step 3: Monthly Sales Trend Analysis
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Monthly Sales Trend
monthly_sales = combined_df.groupby(['Year','Month'])['Sales'].sum()

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
monthly_sales.plot(marker='o')
plt.title("Monthly Sales Trend")
plt.xlabel("Year, Month")
plt.ylabel("Total Sales ($)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: City-wise Sales Performance
```python
# City-wise Sales
city_sales = combined_df.groupby('City')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.barplot(x=city_sales.index, y=city_sales.values, palette="viridis")
plt.title("City-wise Sales")
plt.xlabel("City")
plt.ylabel("Total Sales ($)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 5: Top Products Analysis
```python
# Top 10 Products by Sales
top_products = combined_df.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.barplot(x=top_products.values, y=top_products.index, palette="magma")
plt.title("Top 10 Products by Sales")
plt.xlabel("Total Sales ($)")
plt.ylabel("Product")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 6: Average Order Value (AOV) Analysis
```python
# AOV per City
city_orders = combined_df.groupby('City')['Order ID'].nunique()
city_sales_total = combined_df.groupby('City')['Sales'].sum()
aov_city = (city_sales_total / city_orders).sort_values(ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.barplot(x=aov_city.index, y=aov_city.values, palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Average Order Value per City")
plt.xlabel("City")
plt.ylabel("Average Order Value ($)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 7: Time Series Aggregation for ARIMA
```python
# Aggregate Monthly Sales
monthly_sales_agg = combined_df.groupby(['Year','Month'])['Sales'].sum().reset_index()
monthly_sales_agg['YearMonth'] = pd.to_datetime(monthly_sales_agg['Year'].astype(str) + '-' + 
                                                 monthly_sales_agg['Month'].astype(str))
monthly_sales_agg.set_index('YearMonth', inplace=True)

# Set frequency to Month Start (MS)
ts = monthly_sales_agg['Sales'].asfreq('MS')
print(ts.head())
```

### Step 8: Fit ARIMA Model and Forecast
```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Create train/test split
train = monthly_sales_agg['Sales']  # Use full 2019 for training
# Forecast for future periods
arima_model = ARIMA(train, order=(1,1,1))
arima_fit = arima_model.fit()

# Forecast for next 12 months
forecast_arima = arima_fit.forecast(steps=12)
print("ARIMA Forecast:")
print(forecast_arima)
```

### Step 9: Plot Forecast Results
```python
# Plot forecast
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(train.index, train.values, label='Train (2019)', marker='o')
plt.plot(forecast_arima.index, forecast_arima.values, label='ARIMA Forecast', marker='x', color='green')
plt.title("Monthly Sales Forecast (ARIMA)")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Sales ($)")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Step 10: Forecast Accuracy Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error, mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# If you have actual test data
# mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(actual_test, forecast_arima) * 100
# rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual_test, forecast_arima))
# print(f"MAPE: {mape:.2f}%")
# print(f"RMSE: ${rmse:,.2f}")

# Model summary
print(arima_fit.summary())
```
